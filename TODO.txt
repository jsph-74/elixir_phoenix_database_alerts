----FROM HERE on WORK IN PROGRESS, DONT DO anything! 

1) SSL for prod: the service must be ssl'd... databases contain sensitive iformation. 

-There should be: a script in crypto to set up ssl for production
 
- If the user does not have a certificate or wants to use an "autosigned" certificate, 
he can run another script before to generate the certficate (create ssl certificate).

- The operations should ideally work inside the container. There we can guarantee 
libs for creating a certificate

- Info in the readme about how to do that.

- Prod should redirect http to https 

First lets talk about the approach to tackle this 

2) Login via only password 
3) Master password config
